### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_OTTO_STRASSER_DESC:0 "Otto Strasser was born in Windshelm, Bavaria, on September 10, 1897. Being part of the working class he joined the Social Democratic Party but soon found it disgusting to be in the same party of people that put down a workers’ uprising in the Rhur. Otto soon left and joined the NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers’ Party), where his brother, Gregor, had worked as a journalist for the party for many years previously. Otto Strasser, Joseph Goebbels, and his brother quickly rose through the ranks of the party and eventually became the leader of the party’s left faction in Germany. Then a man who called himself Adolf Hitler joined the NSDAP and quickly asserted himself in the party ranks, believing that Otto Strasser’s ideas were too extreme for Germany and caused a divide deepening ever wider. It wasn’t uncommon for Otto and Adolf to have arguments over which way the party should lean to. These arguments got worse and worse, the whole party would yell at each other, and pretty soon it was not uncommon for the party members to attack each other. However, Hitler’s charisma overtook the party and Otto Strasser resigned from the party in disgrace along with numerous other people. Otto, Gregor, and Goebbels quickly formed a new party called the “Black Front” and were natural rivals with the NSDAP, Otto’s previous party. Even now party members and party cronies fight each other on streets and in dark alleys. Neither party will be satisfied until the other drops dead, figuratively and literally."
POLITICS_KARL_I_DESC:0 "Karl I of Austria was born on August 17, 1887, to a wealthy royal family commonly known as the Habsburg’s. This same royal family united Austria as one thanks to Karl’s grandfather Archduke Karl Ludwig. After the death of Franz Ferdinand due to the Spanish flu, Karl became the next in line for the Austrian throne, then in 1916 Emperor Franz Joseph died due to pneumonia in the right lung. Karl I is in charge of a fallen from grace Austria, in charge of unruly Hungarians who refuse to see Austria as their rightful ruler, and is in charge of a nation that is slowly losing international respect. But something is in the wind and everything is appearing at just the right time in just the right place for Austria to regain its former glory. The only question is if Karl and Austria are ready to truly reclaim their place in the sun, and if Austria can hold itself together to see it through, after all, it’s only a matter of time."
POLITICS_ALEXANDER_KERENSKY_DESC:0 "Alexander Kerensky was born on May 4, 1881 to a lower-middle class family, many people believe that him being born into this family made him a reformer, but it was really the assassination of Tsar Nicholas II in 1901 that turned him into a radical reformer. Kerensky spent the next 11 years gathering support in the Russian Empire against the tsar’s corrupt regime, risking prison and death, as well as gaining a seat in the Russian parliament. But due to increased anger in Tsar Michael Alexandrovsky, the people and peasants revolted in the name of a Russian republic. Many lives were lost on both sides in the Russian Civil war, and when the civil war ended in 1918, not a lot of people had confidence in Kerensky’s Russia. Kerensky and America then formed the world security pact in order to secure peace and stability in the world. However, the tsar was exiled to a secret location that only he knows, Lenin is committed to a guerilla war in the east to undermine the current government’s administration, and the world security pact does nothing for the stability and security of the world, leading to talks about possibly dismantling the entire idea. Times are tough for Russia, and they’re just going to get tougher. Can Kerensky push through this crisis with the people behind him or will he fail Russia and leave it to the fires of revolution?"
POLITICS_VLADIMIR_LENIN_DESC:0 "Vladimir Lenin was born on April 22, 1870 ironically to a moderately wealthy family. Founding the communist party in Russia in 1912, Lenin went on to inspire the peasants, the poor, and the workers. After the Russian civil war ended in 1918 to a Republican Russia, it quickly became very unstable. Lenin knew what he had to do, it was time to reform Russia in a communist direction, although socialism will do. The reforms Lenin thought of gave rising popularity to his communist party. But the Russian parliament scorned him and banned his party, making Lenin and his loyal supporters to defy the Russian republic and forge guerrilla warfare in eastern Russia. And now Lenin is in charge of a truly united Russia, where the people shall have peace, land, and bread forever! And be free of dictatorship forever! . . . But as always, there’s always a bad egg in the pile, the only question is who they are and when they’ll execute their plans. Russia is yours Lenin... for the time-being."
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_DESC:0 "Herbert Hoover was born on August 10, 1874, in West Branch, Iowa, United States of America. Winning the 1928 presidential election against Al Smith, and again winning against FDR on the grounds that if he was elected for a second term he would retake Texas during his first hundred days in office. He lied. This evolved in 1935 when the rest of the south seceded in order to protect their lifestyle of slavery. Overall, Hoover’s political life has been extremely controversial these past years, lying to the general public. However, life in America has been swell during his administration, but remember, there’s always the calm before the storm, the only question is what will it be? Will it be an economic crash? Will it be war with the south? Or will it be the failure of the American government, leading to their total collapse?"
